## Solution A2: Creating a *Python*-Project


<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
The assignment shows good practices how to create and structure a *Python*
project. Few rules should be followed when creating a new software development.
They generally apply, regardless of the programming language:

- source code resides in the `src` directory (sub-tree) in the project
    directory.

- test code (unit tests) is always separated from the source code and typically
    resides in a `tests` directory (sub-tree).

- each, `src` and `tests`, have sub-directories to further structure the source
    code. The structure underneath `tests` mirrors the structure under `src`.

- only source code is under code management (e.g. *git*), no built artifacts,
    tools or binaries.

- a *build-process* must be defined and communicated in a project such that
    the project can be *"built"* any time from scratch.

*Python* does not assume or enforces (unlike Java/maven) any structure of a
software development project.

Read article by Ken Reitz:
[*"Structuring Your Project"*](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure)
to learn about *best-practices* that should be followed in *Python* according to
Ken Reitz (obviously, this particular approach can be debated, but it is quite
common).

---

Goal of this assignment is to set-up a new *Python* project following the guidance
from the article.
The project will create two components, a *"Calculator"* with methods:

- *add(a, b)* - return the sum of *a* and *b*, 

- *sub(a, b)* - subtract *b* from *a*,

- *mul(a, b)* - multiply *a* and *b*,

- *div(a, b)* - divide *a* by *b*,

- *factorize( n )* - return prime factors of *n*.

*"Calculator"* is a singleton component.


*"Collection"* provides *list* and *set* methods:

- *contains( s, e )* - calculate the number of times element *e* is in *s*,

- *zip(s, p)* - pair consequitive elements from *s* and *p*,

- *pset( s )* - calculate the powerset of *s*,

- *perm( p )* - calculate permutations of *p*,

*"Collection"* is an instantiatable component.

### 2. Create Project: "py-fun"

Find a proper workspace (directory) on your laptop to host the new project:

```sh
# cd to the directory where you store your Python projects
cd <path-to-workspace>

mkdir py-fun                    # create the new project 'py-fun'

cd py-fun                       # cd into the new project

mkdir -p src/calculator             # make the directory for the 'Calculator'
mkdir -p tests/calculator           # make directory for 'Calculator' tests

url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sgra64/py-fun/refs/heads/main"
curl -o makefile $url/makefile          # fetch 'makefile' from URL
curl -o requirements.txt $url/requirements.txt
curl -o main.py $url/main.py            # fetch 'main.py' from URL
curl -o src/main.py $url/src/main.py    # fetch 'src/main.py'
curl -o src/__init__.py $url/src/__init__.py

mkdir docs                      # create the docs directory
# fetch content of docs directory

mkdir .vscode                   # create the .vscode directory
# fetch content of .vscode directory

find .                          # show project scaffold
```

Output shows the files of the project:

```
./docs
./docs/conf.py
./docs/index.rst
./docs/makefile
./main.py
./makefile
./requirements.txt
./results.txt
./src
./src/calculator
./src/__init__.py
./src/main.py
./tests
./tests/calculator
```

<!-- 
mkdir docs                      # fetch content of docs directory
curl -o docs/conf.py   $url/docs/conf.py
curl -o docs/index.rst $url/docs/index.rst
curl -o docs/makefile  $url/docs/makefile

mkdir .vscode                   # fetch content of .vscode directory
curl -o .vscode/settings.json $url/.vscode/settings.json
curl -o .vscode/launch.json   $url/.vscode/launch.json
curl -o .vscode/launch-terminal.json $url/.vscode/launch-terminal.json
-->

The diagram shows the project scaffold:

### 3. Build the Project

The *build process* transforms source code into an executable artifact (for
*Python*, this is packaged source code, see
[*Package Formats*](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/discussions/package-formats/)
) that can be released, distributed, deployed and executed.
A source distribution is recognized by its file name, which has the form *package_name-version.tar.gz*, e.g., *pip-23.3.1.tar.gz*.

The *Build Process*:

- *begins* at the point when source code is present and ready for compilation,

- it *ends* when the executable artifact has been created, e.g. a *.tar* file
    *package_name-version.tar.gz*.

Steps of the *Build Process* are:

1. Acquisition of dependencies (required libraries, packages) -- in *Python*,
    dependencies are aquired transitively (including dependencies required
    by dependencies) by package managers such as
    [*pip*](https://pypi.org/project/pip)
    from a central repository such as the
    [*Python Package Index (PyPI)*](https://pypi.org).

1. Running Unit tests.

1. Packaging to the *"executable artifact"*, e.g. *package_name-version.tar.gz*.

For the project, steps of the *Build Process* are implemented as *make* goals
in the [*makefile*](makefile):

1. Dependencies are implicitely acquired with every *Maven* command.

1. `make install` -- installs all dependencies from file
    [*requirements.txt*](requirements.txt).

1. `make run` -- run program [*main.py*](main.py)

1. `make tests` -- perform tests.

1. `make package` -- package project into artifact:
    *py-fun-SNAPSHOT-0.1.0.tar*.

Content created during *build* steps is saved in the *build* folder:

- `build/lib/src` -- *Python* code for packaging.

- `build/lib/tests` -- *Python* tests.

- `build/lib/html` -- *Python* docs.

- `py-fun-SNAPSHOT-0.1.0.tar` -- the final *artifact* created by the *build process*.

Command `make build` performs the complete build process:

```sh
make -n build           # show all build steps to perform (-n: no execution)

make build              # perform all build steps
```

*Python* has several packaging formats:

- [*Wheel*](https://pydevtools.com/handbook/reference/wheel)
    -- a pre-built binary distributions that can be installed with *pip* or *uv*.

- [*sdist*](https://pydevtools.com/handbook/reference/sdist)
    -- source distribution, which is a package format for source code that may need
    to be built during installation.

- [*Conda packages*](https://pydevtools.com/handbook/reference/conda)
    -- a format specific to Conda that can include *non-Python* components.

### 4. Create the *Calculator*

Create a component called *Calculator* in `src/calculator` such that it
provides the indicated functions such that it can be imported and used in
[*src/main.py*](src/main.py):

```py
from .calculator import Calculator

def main():
    # instantiate calculators
    c1 = Calculator()
    c2 = Calculator()
    # 
    print(f' 1: c1.add(1, 2)\t-> {c1.add(1, 2)}')
    print(f' 2: c2.add(8, 3)\t-> {c2.add(8, 3)}')
```

*Python* organizes code as:

- [*Functions*](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp)
    -- a function is a block of code with a name and arguments that runs
    when it is called. A function can return data as a result.

- [*Modules*](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html)
    -- a module is a file containing Python definitions and statements.

- [*Packages*](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects)
    -- a package is a container for distribution that is stored in a
    package/artifact repository from where packages can be fetched and
    installed by a *package manager*.

- [*Classes*](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)
    -- classes bundle data and functionality. Creating a new class creates
    a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made.
    Each class instance can have attributes attached to it (state).
    Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for
    modifying its state.

    Python distinguishes between:

    - [*3.2.8.8. Classes*](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#classes)
        -- classes are callable. These objects normally act as factories for new
        instances of themselves, but variations are possible for class types that
        override __new__(). The arguments of the call are passed to __new__() and,
        in the typical case, to __init__() to initialize the new instance.

    - [*3.2.8.9. Class Instances*](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#class-instances)
        --  instances of classes can be made callable by defining a __call__()
        method in their class.

- [*Objects*, *Values* and *Types*](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html):

    - *Objects* are *Python’s* abstraction for *all data* (*"everything is
        an object"*).

    - *Values* are data elements from ranges defined by types.

    - All objects have *Types*. Classes are just *custom types*, see
        [*What is an Object in Python?*](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56310092/what-is-an-object-in-python).

### 5. Run the *Calculator*

Run the *Calculator* from the project directory:

```sh
make run                # run "the project" ('main.py' in the project directory)

python main.py          # run 'main.py' in the project directory directly
```

Output shows the correct results:

```
 1: c1.add(1, 2)        -> 3
 2: c2.add(8, 3)        -> 11
```

Remove the comment following calculation `2:` in [*src/main.py*](src/main.py):

```py
print(f' 3: c1.add("1", "1")\t-> {c1.add("1", "1")}')     # <-- uncomment
# print(f' 4: c1.add("X", "V")\t-> {c1.add("X", "V")}')
# print(f' 5: c2.factorize(99)\t-> {c1.factorize(99)}')
```

Run the code:

```
 1: c1.add(1, 2)        -> 3
 2: c2.add(8, 3)        -> 11
 3: c1.add("1", "1")    -> 11
```

Why does calculation `add("1", "1")` yields `11` and not as expected `2`?

### 6. Extend the *Calculator*

Fix the problem such that the calculation before returns the expected value `2`.

The following calculations show that *Calculator* has extended capabilities:

- *Calculator* understands names of *single-digit* numbers in *English*,
    *German*, *Spanish*, *Russian* (in *Cyrillic*) and *Chinese*.
    
    Examples:

    - *c1.add("one", "four")* --> `5`,
    - "drei" + 9 --> `12`, "четыре" + "eight" --> `12`,
    - "三" (3) + "四" (4) --> 7.

- *Calculator* also understands *Latin* *single-digit* numbers.

    Examples:

    - "I" + "II" -> `3`, "V" + "IV" -> `9`, "VIII" / "II" -> `4`.

- Method *factorize( n )* returns prime factors of *n*.

    Examples:

    - 17: c2.factorize("три")       -> [3] (prime number),
    - 18: c2.factorize("X")         -> [2, 5]
    - 19: c2.factorize("ocho")      -> [2, 2, 2]
    - 20: c2.factorize(3+5)         -> [2, 2, 2]
    - 22: c2.factorize(1092)        -> [2, 2, 3, 7, 13]
    - 23: c2.factorize(32768)       -> [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
    - 24: c2.factorize(10952347)    -> [7, 23, 59, 1153]
    - 25: c2.factorize(100000039)   -> [100000039] (prime number).

Improve the *Calculator* such that it meets these extended capabilities.

Validate your implementation by running all examples in [*src/main.py*](src/main.py).
Enable the expressions list.

```py
# set True to run the examples from the expression list
_run_list=True
expr=[
    'c1.add("1", "1.600")',         # 2.6
    'c1.add("three", "1.600")',     # 4.6
    'c1.add("cinco", "siete")',     # 12
    'c1.add("семь", "восемь")',     # 15
    'c1.add("III", "   VIII")',     # 11
    'c1.add("三", "五")',            # 8
    'c1.add("0", "X")',             # 10
    'c2.add("ocho", "nueve")',      # 17
    'c2.sub("ocho", "nueve")',      # -1
    'c2.mul("ocho", "nueve")',      # 72
    'c2.div("ocho", "dos")',        # 4.0
    '',
    'c2.factorize("три")',          # [3]
    'c2.factorize("X")',            # [2, 5]
    'c2.factorize("ocho")',         # [2, 2, 2]
    'c2.factorize(3+5)',            # [2, 2, 2]
    'c2.factorize(27)',             # [3, 3, 3]
    'c2.factorize(1092)',           # [2, 2, 3, 7, 13]
    'c2.factorize(32768)',          # [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
    'c2.factorize(10952347)',       # [7, 23, 59, 1153]
    'c2.factorize(100000039)',      # [100000039] (prime number)
    '',
] if _run_list else []
```

Correct results can also be found in [*results.txt*](results.txt).

### 7. Check Project into Local *git* Repository

Create local *git* repository and initialize with *empty root commit*:

```sh
git init --initial-branch=main      # create local git repository

git commit --allow-empty -m "root commit (empty)"
git tag root                        # tag commit with "root"
```

Create file
[*.gitignore*](https://github.com/sgra64/se1-play/blob/main/.gitignore)
and commit:

```sh
curl --output .gitignore \
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sgra64/se1-play/refs/heads/main/.gitignore"

git add -f .gitignore && git commit -m "add .gitignore"

git log --oneline                   # show commit log
```
```
e83b77d add .gitignore
5439cbf (tag: root) root commit (empty)
```

Commit: `.vscode` with message: *"add .vscode"*.

Commit files: `makefile`, `requirements.txt` with message: *"add makefile,
requirements.txt"*.

Complete commits such that you have the following commit log:

```sh
git log --oneline                   # show commit log
```
```
6e81be7 (HEAD -> main) add main.py, src/main.py, src/__init__.py, results.txt
a8ff4f4 add docs
fc0f7fc add setup.py
8404050 add makefile, requirements.txt
f3fd353 add .vscode
4718c64 add .gitignore
5439cbf (tag: root) root commit (empty)
```

### 9. Unit Tests

to follow...

<!-- 
Create unit tests for method: *factorize(int n)* with tests:

1. *regular cases:* n=1, n=2, n=3, n=4, n=27, n=65536, n=10952347, n=100000039 (prime number).

1. *corner cases (valid):* n=0, n=2147483646 (MAX_INT-1), n=2147483647 (MAX_INT) -- corner cases test valid input boundaries.

1. *error and exception cases (invalid):* n=-1, n=-10, n=-2147483648 -- exception cases test that the factorize(int n) method throw an IllegalArgumentException with message: negative argument.

Create a new test class:

&nbsp;

### 10. Release

Create release branch:

```sh
git switch main                     # switch to the 'main' branch
git checkout -b release             # branch new 'release' branch off the 'main' branch
git branch                          # show branches
```

Change GAV-coordinates in *pom.xml* for the *artifactId* from `my-app` to `factorizer`
and for *version* from `1.0-SNAPSHOT` to `RELEASE-1.0.0`:
```xml
<groupId>de.factorizer</groupId>
<artifactId>factorizer</artifactId>
<version>RELEASE-1.0.0</version>
```

Commit the change to the release-branch:
```sh
git add . && git commit -m "update pom.xml, GAV to 'de.factorizer' 'RELEASE-1.0.0'"
```

The development is on branch `factorizer` and needs to be merged to the
`release` branch.

See the changes of the upcoming merge of the *factorizer* branch
to the *release* branch:

```sh
git diff HEAD..factorizer --name-status
```
```
M   pom.xml
D   src/main/java/com/mycompany/app/App.java
A   src/main/java/de/factorizer/App.java

R086src/test/java/com/mycompany/app/AppTest.java   src/test/java/de/factorizer/AppTest.java
A   src/test/java/de/factorizer/FactorizerTests.java
```

Merge branch `factorizer` to the `release` branch:
```sh
git merge factorizer
```
```
Auto-merging pom.xml
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in pom.xml
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
